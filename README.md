# Pagination
#### A Treehouse project repository

This project demonstrates my ability to manipulate the DOM from the given `index.html`, `44students.html`, and `64students.html` files with Javascript in order to add pagination. I'll be utilizing `for` loops to both determine which students to display and how the pagination should be displaying (which link is active and how many links).
